    "# 💻 XYXY AI Technical Test - AI Research Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This short (2-3 hours) technical test is meant to assess your skills in data handling and deep learning. We're looking out for (in no particular order):\n",
    "1. Problem scoping, big picture analysis, and clarity of thought;\n",
    "2. Scientific approach: your ability to analyze and identify issues with data and perform reasonable analysis on failure cases;\n",
    "3. Familiarity with training and testing deep learning models;\n",
    "4. Code cleanliness and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙ Task Background\n",
    "* Any resemblance to any organizations or real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.\n",
    "* [Jack Sweeney](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/elon-musk-jet-tracking.html), the Twitter kid that tracks Elon Musk and other celebs' flight activity, has decided to put on his big boy pants and run a startup that tackles geospatial analysis using deep learning.\n",
    "* Jack realized that **real satellitea imagery is extremely expensive to acquire**, and the startup **would not be able to afford procuring, labeling, and processing** the massive amount of satellite imagery needed for deep learning (considering the general unlikelihood of aircraft appearances).\n",
    "* Instead of training on expensive real data, Jack is testing out **xyxy** synthetic satellite imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💬 Problem statement\n",
    "* Help Jack make a decision on data strategy by **quantitatively comparing training with synthetic data against training entirely on real data.**\n",
    "* Do this by training an object detection model that performs aircraft detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Deliverables\n",
    "* Write a **plan of action** describing how you would approach the problem. You are free to do a short literature review, research, and cite resources.\n",
    "* **Implement the plan** with the provided resources.\n",
    "* **Document** your steps, reasoning, and design decisions. Clarify anything with us if necessary (and also document that).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎁 Provisions\n",
    "* Model training code boilerplate (in this notebook)\n",
    "* Data package containing the following:\n",
    "    * xyxy synthetic training images and labels (~100MB, 2000 images)\n",
    "    * RarePlanes real training images and labels (~2GB, 5815 images)\n",
    "    * RarePlanes real test images and labels (-900MB, 2710 images)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Constraints\n",
    "What can't you do? In general, this is a very permissive test: you may do anything as long as you abide by the following:\n",
    "* You must include synthetic data in training.\n",
    "* You may use any open source libraries or publicly available code, as long as you document their usage.\n",
    "* If you have a wild but suspiciously sneaky idea, please check in with us and we'll give some advice. Keep in mind the test objectives at the top of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👀 What We Expect\n",
    "* **Don't focus on blindly grinding out model performance**. While it is important to show that synthetic data works, it is also valuable to understand specific cases where it **doesn't** (provide hypotheses and reasoning, and possible solutions).\n",
    "* The deeper you can push analysis and insight on data, training, and evaluation, the better!\n",
    "* You are free to use any model architecture. When choosing a model, document decisions about tradeoffs between performance and size/speed, keeping in mind development and training time.\n",
    "* The model architecture and hyperparameter tuning are not very important. Use smaller models, reasonable baselines, transfer learning, or other tricks to spin up the training process as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🤫 More Hints\n",
    "* `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` to use hardware accelerators.\n",
    "* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided data and annotations. You may need to manipulate or fix the synthetic dataset's COCO JSON files.\n",
    "* You may find it useful to define a quantitative performance metric (use and cite a standard open-source implementation) and visualize the distribution of failure cases.\n",
    "* You are free to re-organize the real training and test datasets however you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📐 Other Rules\n",
    "* Please respect the integrity of the test! Do it yourself, and don't share it with anyone. Violating these may be grounds for disqualification.\n",
    "* If you would like to complete the test locally (not on Colab), you may download the data [from this link (~3GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F6s079_J-J6xAEDC84kelmlW2gSHH-70/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "* Do contact the xyxy team in case you need additional clarifications!\n",

    "# 📓 Action plan\n",
    "\n",
    "This a stream of consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check with reality\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the time line 2/3 hours is not possible to do a litterature review that is not a simple google/chatGPT question, therefore I will rely on what I know at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the time line I am not sure how I can train and test different models, is not really important thus we will use the simpliest thing possibile in this world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the time line and the fact we are coding on jupyter, spaghetti code will be our friend today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My goal is to showcase a framework to check models' performances and generability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Please describe your approach here (double click to edit).\n",
    "Feel free to use any additional resources if you like, e.g. external resources, slides, diagrams, images, or handwritten notes! But do link them here. While it should be technical, please make sure the plan written in this section is presentable and easily digestible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 Empirical Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are made for human, first step is to sample some images from the real and the synthetic ones and empirically check that they makes sense. This is not scientific but it's a cheap and fast way to catch weird stuff - e.g. sythentic images do not contains planes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 Labels Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the real training split since we won't be using it, we want to check that labels distribution are comparable across sythetic images and real one. \n",
    "- check `num_boxes` distribution is similar to the real one\n",
    "- check `classes` distribution is similar to the real one\n",
    "- **very important** check `boxes_area` distribution is similar to the real one, if you use one of the old school methos with anchors this is even more important\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embeddings\n",
    "We can check both datasets are semantically similar by embedding the data (or a statistical meaningful sample) by something like CLIP and assert the two embeddings space are somehow similar using similarity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metrics\n",
    "We can evaluate the model's performance on the real test set, and see if they are on pair (or decent) with the train test. For object detection, we can use mAP and anything `>0.6` is a win for `iou>0.5`.\n",
    "- we check failures at evaluation time, and we record them (e.g. FP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the model performs well. We asserted our synthetic data does the job. If it doesn't, well we need to ping poing the issue. Good rule of thumb is before doing anything else, retrain the model with half the lr and more epoches and check that there is no overfitting and the loss curve is nice. If you are confident the model training is not the issue \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Augmentations\n",
    "We can check that our model is robust by sampling the test set and run augmentation on it and record the model's performance and check if it drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embeddings (again!)\n",
    "We can take the backbone of our model, embed the train set and the real test set and check that they map two similar images in a similar spot.\n",
